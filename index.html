            <h2>A little about me,</h2>
            <p>
              in 2021 I decided to make the switch from working as a Chef de
              Partie, to focus on my other passion, IT. My first memory with
              computers has to be
              <a

              In the early 2000s. If you don't know, it's a side-scrolling shooter
              kinda game, with all sorts of weird hallucinogenic themes. Great
              stuff. Then, I went on to play Diablo II for almost a decade and the
              World of Warcraft, oh how, far the mighty have fallen. Aside from
              games, I love all things tech. I built my first PC when I was 12 and
              ever since then, I've been the "nerd-to-call" within my social
              circles. Aside from games, I'm into all things tech. Currently I'm
              learning CSS (fuck you!), HTML and C#, and Linux. However, I have a
              solid feeling I won't be able to escape JavaScript (hopefully
              TypeScript?). <br />We'll see.

          <section>
            <h2>What can you expect?</h2>
          <p>
            Not much really. Once I get this homepage right, it won't change
            much. The rest of the pages on this website will change however.
            It's going to be my little sandbox, where I can try out and
            testdrive new ideas or things that I've learned.

            <p>
              Finding the right tool or resource for the job is the hardest part
              of teaching yourself anything. Especially if you want to mainly use
              OpenSource stuff. Although it might be difficult at first, you'll
              soon realize you've been paying for Big-Tech execs' vacations this
              whole time without getting much back and selling your soul. <br> <br>
              So here's all the stuff that I am personally thankful for:

          <h2>A little about me,</h2>
          <p>
            in 2021 I decided to make the switch from working as a Chef de
            Partie, to focus on my other passion, IT. My first memory with
            computers has to be

            in the early 2000s. If you don't know, it's a side-scrolling shooter
            kinda game, with all sorts of weird hallucinogenic themes. Great
            stuff. Then, I went on to play Diablo II for almost a decade and the
            World of Warcraft, oh how, far the mighty have fallen. Aside from
            games, I love all things tech. I built my first PC when I was 12 and
            ever since then, I've been the "nerd-to-call" within my social
            circles. Aside from games, I'm into all things tech. Currently I'm
            learning CSS (fuck you!), HTML and C#, and Linux. However, I have a
            solid feeling I won't be able to escape JavaScript (hopefully
            TypeScript?). <br />We'll see.

          <h2>What can you expect?</h2>
          <p>
            Not much really. Once I get this homepage right, it won't change
            much. The rest of the pages on this website will change however.
            It's going to be my little sandbox, where I can try out and
            testdrive new ideas or things that I've learned.

            <p>
              Finding the right tool or resource for the job is the hardest part
              of teaching yourself anything. Especially if you want to mainly use
              OpenSource stuff. Although it might be difficult at first, you'll
              soon realize you've been paying for Big-Tech execs' vacations this
              whole time without getting much back and selling your soul. <br> <br>
              So here's all the stuff that I am personally thankful for:

                This guy has inspired millions of young people, most of whom are
                young adults now. A failing high-school student, who managed to
                land a job at Cisco and then became a self-made millionaire
                whizzing thrtough the air on a couch. Perhaps one of the most
                influential YouTubers from the COD era. <br />

                Krita is a free and OpenSource digital art tool. It's crazy
                good. <br />
                It's simple and effective and runs pretty great even on an AMD
                "ultrabook".

                My lust for not using Windows and instead using Linux has put me
                on the path to want to know more about the technology that makes
                our world go around. Now, Linux is not for everyone (although it
                could be), but just through using it, you'll gain a greater
                appreciation and understanding of tech. (Fedora) Linux blazing
                fast, realiable and just gets out of your way so you can do what
                you need to do.

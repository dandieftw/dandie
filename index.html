            <h2>A little about me,</h2>
            <p>
              in 2021 I decided to make the switch from working as a Chef de
              Partie, to focus on my other passion, IT. My first memory with
              computers has to be

              In the early 2000s. If you don't know, it's a side-scrolling shooter
              kinda game, with all sorts of weird hallucinogenic themes. Great
              stuff. Then, I went on to play Diablo II for almost a decade and the
              World of Warcraft, oh how, far the mighty have fallen. Aside from
              games, I love all things tech. I built my first PC when I was 12 and
              ever since then, I've been the "nerd-to-call" within my social
              circles. Aside from games, I'm into all things tech. Currently I'm
              learning CSS (fuck you!), HTML and C#, and Linux. However, I have a
              solid feeling I won't be able to escape JavaScript (hopefully
              TypeScript?). <div class="standoutText"><p>We'll see.</p></div>

            <h2>What can you expect?</h2>
          <p>
            Changes. Lots of changes.
            It's going to be my little sandbox, where I can try out and
            testdrive new ideas or things that I've learned. One week that might be CSS, the other it might be JS or C# (perhaps Rust?)
            It will also be used to showcase different projects I've taken part in. So kind of like a portfolio. It's neat to little page
            I can document my work with.

            <p>
              Finding the right tool or resource for the job is the hardest part
              of teaching yourself anything. Especially if you want to mainly use
              OpenSource stuff. Although it might be difficult at first, you'll
              soon realize you've been paying for Big-Tech execs' vacations this
              whole time without getting much back and selling your soul. Now, finding the right resource is equally difficult, if not more difficult.
              To stay motivated whilst on the road by yourself is no easy task, therefore, having the right people to guide you on that journey is crucial.
              Here's some of the stuff and some of the people that motivate me day-in-day-out.
              
              <div class="standoutText"><p>So here's all the stuff that I am personally thankful for:</p></div>

                <p>
                  My lust for not using Windows and instead using Linux has put me
                  on the path to want to know more about the technology that makes
                  our world go around. Now, Linux is not for everyone (although it
                  could be), but just through using it, you'll gain a greater
                  appreciation and understanding of tech. (Fedora) Linux blazing
                  fast, realiable and just gets out of your way so you can do what
                  you need to do.

                Krita is a free and OpenSource digital art tool. It's crazy
                good. It's simple and effective and runs pretty great even on an AMD
                "ultrabook".

                  young adults now. A failing high-school student, who managed to
